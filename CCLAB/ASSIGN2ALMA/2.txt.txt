To set up KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) with Virt-Manager on AlmaLinux and run a virtualized OS, follow these steps:

Step 1: Update the System
Before proceeding, ensure the system is up-to-date.

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf update -y
sudo reboot
Step 2: Check for Virtualization Support
Verify if your CPU supports virtualization.

bash
Copy code
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
If the output is 0, your CPU does not support virtualization.
If it’s 1 or more, proceed.
Step 3: Install KVM and Virtualization Packages
Install KVM, Virt-Manager, and required packages.

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install -y qemu-kvm libvirt libvirt-daemon libvirt-daemon-config-network libvirt-daemon-kvm virt-manager bridge-utils
Step 4: Enable and Start Libvirt Service
Ensure the libvirt service is enabled and running.

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
Check the service status:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status libvirtd
Step 5: Verify Installation
Check if KVM is installed and running properly.

bash
Copy code
sudo virsh list --all
You should see an empty list of VMs if everything is configured correctly.

Step 6: Add Current User to the libvirt Group
Add your user to the libvirt group to manage virtual machines without sudo.

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Step 7: Install and Configure Virt-Manager
Launch the Virt-Manager GUI:

bash
Copy code
virt-manager
If it doesn’t launch via the terminal, use the system menu.

Step 8: Create a Virtual Machine
Open Virt-Manager.
Click on File > New Virtual Machine.
Choose installation source:
For ISO: Select Local install media (ISO image or CDROM).
For network-based installation: Choose Network Install.
Configure:
Memory and CPU allocation.
Disk image (e.g., create a 20GB QCOW2 disk).
Follow the prompts to complete the setup.
Step 9: Start the Virtual Machine
Once created, start the VM by selecting it in Virt-Manager and clicking Start.

Step 10: Troubleshooting
If you face network issues, ensure the default network is active:

bash
Copy code
sudo virsh net-list
If inactive, start it:

bash
Copy code
sudo virsh net-start default
sudo virsh net-autostart default
This completes the installation and setup of KVM with Virt-Manager on AlmaLinux. You can now install and run virtualized operating systems!
