Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to install KVM and Virt-Manager on a Linux platform and run a virtualized OS:

Step 1: Update the System
Run the following command to ensure your system is up-to-date:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Step 2: Check Hardware Virtualization Support
Verify if your CPU supports hardware virtualization:

bash
Copy code
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
If the output is greater than 0, your CPU supports virtualization.
You can also check virtualization support:

bash
Copy code
lscpu | grep Virtualization
Step 3: Install KVM and Related Packages
Install KVM, qemu, and other dependencies:

For Ubuntu/Debian:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
For Fedora/RHEL:
bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install -y @virtualization
sudo dnf install -y virt-manager libvirt-daemon-config-network
Step 4: Enable and Start Libvirt Service
Start and enable the libvirt service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
Verify the service is running:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status libvirtd
Step 5: Add User to KVM Group
Add your user to the libvirt and kvm groups for permission to manage virtual machines:

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG libvirt,kvm $USER
Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

Step 6: Launch Virt-Manager
Start Virt-Manager with the following command:

bash
Copy code
virt-manager
Alternatively, search for "Virtual Machine Manager" in your desktop environment.

Step 7: Create a Virtual Machine
Open Virt-Manager.
Click on "New Virtual Machine".
Choose one of the following:
Use a local installation media (ISO image).
Network boot (PXE).
Provide the path to the ISO file of the operating system.
Allocate CPU and memory resources for the virtual machine.
Create or select a disk image for storage.
Finish the setup and start the virtual machine.
Step 8: (Optional) Configure Networking
For a bridged network, edit /etc/network/interfaces or use nmcli to configure a bridge interface. Ensure the bridge is configured in Virt-Manager under the network settings.

Step 9: Manage Virtual Machines
Use Virt-Manager to:

Start, stop, or pause VMs.
Edit virtual hardware settings.
This will set up and allow you to manage virtual machines using KVM and Virt-Manager effectively. If you face issues, let me know!
